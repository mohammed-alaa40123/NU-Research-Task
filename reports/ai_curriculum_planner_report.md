## Executive Summary

This report presents the development and implementation of an AI-powered academic advising system that uses graph-based curriculum modeling and reinforcement learning to provide personalized course recommendations for 100 simulated students. The system demonstrates significant potential for improving student academic outcomes through intelligent course scheduling that considers individual interests, academic constraints, and graduation timeline optimization.

## 1. System Architecture and Design

### 1.1 Graph-Based Curriculum Model

The curriculum is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where:
- **Nodes** represent 32 computer science courses with attributes:
  - Course code and name
  - Academic domain (AI, Security, Data Science, Software Engineering, Systems, Theory)
  - Difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
  - Credit hours (typically 3 credits)
- **Edges** represent prerequisite relationships between courses
- **Constraints** ensure academic integrity and progression requirements

The graph structure enables efficient prerequisite checking, topological sorting for valid course sequences, and identification of critical paths and bottleneck courses.

### 1.2 Student Simulation Framework

We generated 100 diverse student profiles using a sophisticated simulation algorithm that models:
- **Academic History**: Realistic progression through foundational courses
- **Grade Distribution**: Domain-specific performance based on student interests and course difficulty
- **Interest Profiles**: Weighted preferences across 6 academic domains
- **Academic Standing**: GPA-based classification (Good, Warning, Probation)
- **Graduation Timeline**: Individualized targets based on current progress

The simulation produces realistic student cohorts with:
- GPA distribution: Mean 2.85 (Range: 1.2-3.8)
- Course completion: Mean 12.4 courses (Range: 4-24)
- Academic standing: 68% Good, 24% Warning, 8% Probation

### 1.3 Constraint Management System

The system enforces multiple academic constraints:
- **Course Load Limits**: 3-5 courses per term based on student capacity
- **Prerequisite Requirements**: Strict enforcement of course dependencies
- **Retake Policies**: Maximum 2 retakes per course, 5 total retakes
- **GPA Requirements**: Minimum 2.5 GPA for advanced courses
- **Graduation Progress**: Domain coverage and credit accumulation tracking

## 2. Reinforcement Learning Approach

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

The course recommendation problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP):

**State Space**: Student academic state vector containing:
- Binary encoding of completed courses (32 dimensions)
- Normalized GPA (0-1 scale)
- Current term progress (0-1 scale)
- Academic interest vector (6 dimensions)
- Academic standing indicators (3 dimensions)
- **Total State Size**: 44 dimensions

**Action Space**: Selection of 3-5 courses from eligible options
- Dynamic action space based on prerequisite satisfaction
- Constraint-filtered to ensure valid selections

**Reward Function**: Multi-objective optimization combining:
- Interest alignment: Σ(course_domain_interest × 2.0)
- Progress reward: credits_earned × 0.5
- GPA improvement potential: estimated_grade_boost × 0.1
- Constraint compliance: constraint_score × 3.0
- Advanced course bonus: advanced_courses × 0.5
- Sequence bonus: logical_progression × 0.3

### 2.2 Deep Q-Network Architecture

The DQN employs a fully connected neural network:
- **Input Layer**: 44 state features
- **Hidden Layers**: [512, 256, 128] neurons with ReLU activation
- **Dropout**: 0.2 for regularization
- **Output Layer**: 32 Q-values (one per course)
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate 0.001

### 2.3 Training Process

The training process uses experience replay and target network updates:
- **Episodes**: 100 training episodes with diverse student profiles
- **Exploration**: ε-greedy policy with decay (1.0 → 0.01)
- **Experience Replay**: Buffer size 10,000 transitions
- **Target Network**: Updated every 10 episodes
- **Batch Size**: 32 for stable learning
