## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Part 1: Curriculum and Student Simulation
- **Graph-based curriculum**: 34 CS courses with prerequisite dependencies
- **Realistic student profiles**: 100 diverse students with academic histories
- **Constraint modeling**: Course load limits, prerequisites, retake policies
- **Data export**: JSON format with curriculum and student data

### ✅ Part 2: AI-Based Personalization
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Deep Q-Network (DQN) for course recommendations
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Balances GPA, interests, and graduation progress
- **Constraint compliance**: Validates recommendations against academic rules
- **Personalized suggestions**: Tailored to individual student profiles

## 🔧 Quick Commands

```bash
# Generate curriculum and student data
python main.py --generate-data --num-students 100

# Train DQN algorithm
python main.py --train-rl --episodes 2000

# Generate course recommendations
python main.py --recommend

# Create visualizations
python main.py --visualize

# Run complete pipeline
python main.py --complete

# Show sample results
python main.py --sample-results
```
