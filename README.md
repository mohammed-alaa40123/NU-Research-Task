## Usage

### Streamlit Web Application (Recommended)
Launch the interactive dashboard:
```bash
cd app
streamlit run main.py
```

The web application provides:
- **Home**: Overview dashboard with key statistics and system metrics
- **Curriculum Graph**: Interactive visualization of course prerequisites and relationships
- **Student Analysis**: Population-level analytics with filtering and insights
- **Student Dashboard**: Individual student profiles and academic progress
- **Course Recommendations**: RL-generated personalized course suggestions
- **Training Metrics**: Deep Q-Network training progress and performance analytics
- **Data Explorer**: Raw data inspection and statistical distributions

### Command Line Interface
Generate data and train models via CLI:

#### 1. Generate Curriculum and Student Data
```bash
python main.py --generate-data
```

#### 2. Train RL Model
```bash
python main.py --train-rl --episodes 2000
```

#### 3. Generate Recommendations
```bash
python main.py --recommend
```

#### 4. Visualize Results
```bash
python main.py --visualize
```

## Key Components

### Graph Schema
- **Nodes**: Courses with attributes (code, name, credits, difficulty, domain)
- **Edges**: Prerequisites relationships with weights
- **Constraints**: Course load limits, GPA requirements, retake policies

### Student Data Generation
The system generates realistic student profiles using sophisticated statistical distributions:

#### Academic Ability Distribution
- **Student Ability**: Beta(2, 2) distribution - creates realistic bell-curve of academic performance
- **Grade Simulation**: Course-specific normal distributions based on difficulty and student factors

#### Grade Distribution Parameters
```python
Grade Means by Difficulty:
- Beginner courses: Î¼ = 3.2, Ïƒ = 0.6
- Intermediate courses: Î¼ = 2.9, Ïƒ = 0.8  
- Advanced courses: Î¼ = 2.7, Ïƒ = 0.9
```

#### Interest Profile Generation
- **Primary Interests**: Each student has 1-3 primary domains (0.7-1.0 interest level)
- **Secondary Interests**: Other domains receive 0.1-0.5 interest level
- **Domains**: AI, Security, Data Science, Software Engineering, Systems, Theory

#### Academic Progression Modeling
- **Course Selection**: Interest-weighted scoring with term appropriateness
- **Failure Simulation**: Courses with grade < 2.0 marked as failed
- **GPA Calculation**: Credit-weighted average of passed courses only
- **Academic Standing**: Determined by GPA and failed course count
  - Good: GPA â‰¥ 3.0 and â‰¤1 failed course
  - Warning: GPA â‰¥ 2.0 
  - Probation: GPA < 2.0

### Reinforcement Learning Algorithm
The system uses **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** for personalized course recommendations:

#### State Representation
```python
State Vector Components:
- Course completion binary vector (one-hot encoding)
- Current GPA (normalized 0-1)
- Current term (normalized 0-1) 
- Credits completed (normalized 0-1)
- Failed courses count (normalized)
- Academic standing (one-hot)
- Interest vector (6 domains, 0-1 each)
```

#### Action Space
- **Actions**: Select 3-5 courses for next term
- **Constraints**: Must satisfy prerequisites and academic policies
- **Validation**: Real-time constraint checking via AcademicConstraints class

#### Reward Function
The reward function balances multiple objectives:

```python
R(s,a) = R_interest + R_constraints + R_count + R_difficulty

Where:
- R_interest = Î£(interest_level Ã— 5.0) for each course
- R_constraints = +5.0 if valid, -min(3.0, violationsÃ—0.5) if invalid  
- R_count = +2.0 if exactly 3 courses, -2.0Ã—(excess) if >3
- R_difficulty = +1.0 for GPA-appropriate difficulty matching
```

#### Network Architecture
- **Input Layer**: State vector (variable size based on curriculum)
- **Hidden Layers**: [512, 256, 128] neurons with ReLU activation
- **Dropout**: 0.2 rate for regularization
- **Output Layer**: Q-values for each possible course

### Score Functions and Equations

#### Interest Alignment Score
```python
Interest_Score = Î£(course_domain_interest Ã— weight) / num_courses
```

#### GPA Prediction
```python
New_GPA = (current_GPA Ã— current_credits + Î£(predicted_grade Ã— credits)) / total_credits
```

#### Graduation Efficiency
```python
Efficiency = (remaining_credits / avg_credits_per_term) / terms_remaining
```

#### Constraint Satisfaction Rate
```python
Satisfaction_Rate = valid_selections / total_recommendations
```

## Example Results
The system generates personalized recommendations for each student, considering:
- **Academic Prerequisites**: Ensures all prerequisite courses are completed
- **Individual Interests**: Matches recommendations to student's domain preferences
- **GPA Optimization**: Suggests appropriate difficulty levels based on academic standing
- **Graduation Timeline**: Balances course load with efficient degree completion
- **Learning Sequences**: Recommends logical course progressions within domains

### Sample Recommendation Output
```json
{
  "student_id": "Student_042",
  "recommended_courses": ["CS310", "SEC301", "DS201"],
  "reasoning": {
    "interest_match": 0.89,
    "difficulty_appropriate": true,
    "prerequisites_satisfied": true,
    "estimated_gpa_impact": +0.15
  }
}
